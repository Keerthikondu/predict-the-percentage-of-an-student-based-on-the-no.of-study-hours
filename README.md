Project Title: Predicting Student Scores Using Linear Regression
Introduction
In this project, we aim to predict the percentage score of a student based on the number of hours they study. This task involves building a simple linear regression modelâ€”a fundamental concept in machine learning that helps understand the relationship between two variables.

This project is provided by The Sparks Foundation as part of my internship. The goal is to apply supervised machine learning techniques to predict a student's score using Python.

Objective
The main objective of this project is to:

Build a linear regression model to predict the percentage of a student based on the number of hours they study.
Understand the relationship between study hours and performance (scores).
Evaluate the performance of the regression  model using appropriate metrics.
